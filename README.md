	ğŸŒˆ A repo to manage my domain aliases, assets, etc.
</h3>

## ğŸ“Œ Overview

That's the repository I use to centralize domain aliases (I have an [script that integrates with Netlify](./scripts/syncDomainAliases.js) and makes all the aliases present on the [domain aliases file](./domainAliases.json)) and store my static files (such as scripts, stylesheets, etc).

The static files can be reached by static.guilherr.me and the domain aliases can be found at redirects.guilherr.me.
